# Absa Selenium #

This assessment is based on Task 2. Here Selenium framework tool I used with the help of Java (Maven).


On this assessment I decided to use Keyword-Driven testing methodology. The idea behind keyword driven 
testing is to separate the coding from the test case and the test steps.

Please follow the steps below:

1.	Clone the repository to your machine (C:\) drive
2.	Download and install IntelliJ IDE Community 2019 https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/other.html
3.	Install IntelliJ IDE
4.	Open the cloned project via IntelliJ IDE
5.	Let IDE auto setup a bit 
6.	Navigate to package “test”-> “java”->”Absa_Web_UI_test”.
7.	There’re two classes named “Task_Two_TestSuite_one java and Task_Two_TestSuite_two.java”. 
8.	Right click on either and select “Run  Task_Two_TestSuite_one”, this will therefor execute the test.
9.	When you have executed the tests, open the project on C:\ driver
10.	Open the “Report” folder, continue opening the sub-folders until you reach “extentReport.html” file, and open this .html file.
11.	Test report presented.
